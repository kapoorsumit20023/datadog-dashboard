# Automated Dashboard Generation Plan

This file outlines the plan to incorporate automated Datadog dashboard generation based on metric prefixes, inspired by borgified/terraform-datadog-dashboard.

## Goals
- Add Terraform modules/scripts to generate dashboards/widgets based on metric naming conventions.
- Parameterize dashboard creation (e.g., metric prefix, dashboard title).
- Provide example usage and documentation.
- Ensure compatibility with existing provider and variable structure.
